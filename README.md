# ANSI-Art-to-BashBunny
This is a quick bash script I wrote in response to Hak5 2506. 

# Usage
```
Usage: ./ansi-to-bashbunny.sh FILE
FILE should be a plaintext file that contains the ANSI art you wish to convert into a BashBunny payload
```
By default this script will output to STDOUT, but you can easily redirect that into a file:
```
./ansi-to-bashbunnsy.sh FILE > payload.txt
```
